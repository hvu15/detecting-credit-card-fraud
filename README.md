# Detecting Credit Card Fraud

Applied different machine learning techniques to identify credit card fraud transaction, using Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to get some insights about the data set.

Methods used:
- Supervised Learing: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifier
- Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors
- Deep learning Keras

Accuracy scores were calculated for all models and visualizations for confusion matrix for each model were also created.

To evaluate the importance of features on the classification task, “feature_importances_” was computed using the scikit-learn library from Random Forest Classifier model.
